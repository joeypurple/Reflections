What happens when you initialize a repository ? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden directory is created called .git This turns a normal directory into a git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains all your files. 

Staging only has files you added using git add. Gives you control over what files you add commits to

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Using Commands like git status will show you what files are staged for commit
