When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local ?

If you are working with other people and need them to view and edit files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since changes could be added by other users it might be best to check out those changes first on github before pulling them to the local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is when github clones a repository to your git hub not your local

clone is when you clone either a github repository to your local or clone a local somewhere else on your local pc

branchs is used to test out expermental code without efffecting your production ready master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

That way you can compare the remote before commiting it
