When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local ?

If you are working with other people and need them to view and edit files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since changes could be added by other users it might be best to check out those changes first on github before pulling them to the local repository
